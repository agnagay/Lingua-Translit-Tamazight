0.14  -- 2009-10-16

    * Added Win32 support.
      Please note that a Unix-like environment is still required to develop
      transliteration tables using the provided set of tools.
    * t/03_translit.t: Use $^X rather than relying on the shebang
    * Various trivial fixes, code cleanups and hyperlink updates
    * xml/manual/manual.pod: Added missing markup

0.13  -- 2008-04-29

    * Added developer manual covering the addition of own transliteration
      tables (xml/manual/).
    * Added test template (t/xx_tr_template.t.pl)
    * Makefile.PL:
        * Added "manual" target
        * Suited MSWin32 check for CPAN Testers tools

0.12 -- 2008-04-23

    * Added common Polish transliteration ("Common POL")

0.11 -- 2008-04-21

    * xml/din_1460_bul.xml: changed transliteration of SOFT SIGN to plain
      ASCII apostrophe.
    * New transliterations:
        * Common SLK (Slovak)
        * Common SLV (Slovenian)

0.10 -- 2008-04-17

    * lib/Lingua/Translit.pm, xml/translit.dtd: Contexts can now contain two
      patterns at a time (before and after). These are combined using AND
      logics and therefore act as a logical "inbetween".
    * xml/xml2dump.pl: Switched from XML::Simple to XML::LibXML in order to
      prevent loss of whitespace charactes like U+180E.
    * xml/greeklish.xml: GREEK CAPITAL LETTER UPSILON WITH DIALYTIKA (U+03AB)
      bug fixed.
    * t/13_tr_Greeklish.t: Added test for upsilon bugfix.
    * Added two transliterations for Bulgarian:
        * DIN 1460
        * Streamlined System

0.09 -- 2008-04-09

    * Added Mongolian transliteration "Common Classical MON". Thanks to
      Bayanzul Lodoysamba (baynaa@users.sourceforge.net) for contributing
      this table!
    * lib/Lingua/Translit.pm: "from" and "to" transliteration patterns are
      now evaluated literally only (within \Q and \E).
    * lib/Lingua/Translit/Tables.pm: Removed verbose package information from
      translit_list_supported()
    * translit: Display Lingua::Translit's version if show_list() is called
    * translit: For convenience, every underscore in a transliteration's name
      is substituted by a blank.
    * Makefile.PL: Exit with a hint on MSWin32 rather than dying in
      t/03_translit.t
    * xml/xml2dump.pl: workaround for discarded U+180E character (see l.85)
    * Added a transliteration table template (xml/template.xml)

0.05 -- 2008-03-10

      transliteration explicitly.

0.04 -- 2008-02-28

    * Added common Romanian transliteration ("Common RON")
