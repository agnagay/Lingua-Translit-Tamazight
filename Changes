    * Added Mongolian transliteration "Common Classical MON". Thanks to
      Bayanzul Lodoysamba (baynaa@users.sourceforge.net) for contributing
      this table!
    * lib/Lingua/Translit.pm: "from" and "to" transliteration patterns are
      now evaluated literally only (within \Q and \E).
    * lib/Lingua/Translit/Tables.pm: Removed verbose package information from
      translit_list_supported()
    * translit: Display Lingua::Translit's version if show_list() is called
    * translit: For convenience, every underscore in a transliteration's name
      is substituted by a blank.
    * Makefile.PL: Exit with a hint on MSWin32 rather than dying in
      t/03_translit.t
    * xml/xml2dump.pl: workaround for discarded U+180E character (see l.85)
    * Added a transliteration table template (xml/template.xml)

    * Added common Romanian transliteration ("Common RON")
